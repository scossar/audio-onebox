## Audio Onebox

*note: This plugin is broken. It has not been updated to use the Discourse plugin api. This is example code only.*

This plugin creates a custom player for audio files that are uploaded to
a Discourse forum. It works both for files that are stored on the server and for
files that are stored with Amazon S3.

### Installation

Follow the [Install a Plugin](https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-a-plugin/19157) howto, using
`git clone https://github.com/scossar/audio-onebox` as the plugin command.
